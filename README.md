## Overview

The IBM Cloudant Python SDK allows developers to programmatically
interact with [IBM Cloudant](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant)
with the help of the `ibmcloudant` package.

## Features

The purpose of this Python SDK is to wrap most of the HTTP request APIs
provided by Cloudant and supply other functions to ease the usage of Cloudant.
This SDK should make life easier for programmers to do whatâ€™s really important
to them: developing software.

Reasons why you should consider using Cloudant Python SDK in your
project:

- Supported by IBM Cloudant.
- Server compatibility with:
    - IBM Cloudant "Classic".
    - [Cloudant "Standard on Transaction Engine"](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-overview-te) for APIs compatible with Cloudant "Classic". For more information, see the [Feature Parity](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-overview-te#feature-parity-between-ibm-cloudant-on-the-transaction-engine-vs-classic-architecture) page.
    - [Apache CouchDB 3.x](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/) for data operations.
- Includes all the most popular and latest supported endpoints for
  applications.
- Handles the authentication.
- Familiar user experience with IBM Cloud SDKs.
- Flexibility to use either built-in models or byte-based requests and responses for documents.
- Instances of the client are unconditionally thread-safe.

## Prerequisites

- A
  [Cloudant](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant/getting-started.html#step-1-connect-to-your-cloudant-nosql-db-service-instance-on-ibm-cloud)
  service instance or a
  [CouchDB](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/install/index.html)
  server.
- Python 3.6.7 or above.

## Installation

To install, use `pip` or `easy_install`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade "ibmcloudant>=0.0.29"
```

or

```bash
easy_install --upgrade "ibmcloudant>=0.0.29"
```

## Authentication

[service-credentials]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-instance-on-ibm-cloud#locating-your-service-credentials
[cloud-IAM-mgmt]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-ibm-cloud-identity-and-access-management-iam-
[couch-cookie-auth]: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/server/authn.html#cookie-authentication
[cloudant-cookie-auth]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-authentication#cookie-authentication
[couch-basic-auth]: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/server/authn.html#basic-authentication
[cloudant-basic-auth]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant/api?topic=cloudant-authentication#basic-authentication

This library requires some of your
[Cloudant service credentials][service-credentials] to authenticate with your
account.

1. `IAM`, `COUCHDB_SESSION`, `BASIC` or `NOAUTH` **authentication type**.
    1. [*IAM authentication*](#iam-authentication) is highly recommended when your
    back-end database server is [**Cloudant**][cloud-IAM-mgmt]. This
    authentication type requires a server-generated `apikey` instead of a
    user-given password. You can create one
    [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
    1. [*Session cookie (`COUCHDB_SESSION`) authentication*](#session-cookie-authentication)
    is recommended for [Apache CouchDB][couch-cookie-auth] or for
    [Cloudant][cloudant-cookie-auth] when IAM is unavailable. It exchanges username
    and password credentials for an `AuthSession` cookie from the `/_session`
    endpoint.
    1. [*Basic* (or legacy) *authentication*](#basic-authentication) is a fallback
    for both [Cloudant][cloudant-basic-auth] and [Apache CouchDB][couch-basic-auth]
    back-end database servers. This authentication type requires the good old
    `username` and `password` credentials.
    1. *Noauth* authentication does not require credentials. Note that this
    authentication type only works with queries against a database with read
    access for everyone.
1. The service `url`.

There are several ways to **set** these properties:

1. As [environment variables](#authentication-with-environment-variables)
1. The [programmatic approach](#programmatic-authentication)
1. With an [external credentials file](#authentication-with-external-configuration)

### Authentication with environment variables

#### IAM authentication

For Cloudant *IAM authentication*, set the following environmental variables by
replacing the `<url>` and `<apikey>` with your proper
[service credentials][service-credentials]. There is no need to set
`CLOUDANT_AUTH_TYPE` to `IAM` because it is the default.

```bash
CLOUDANT_URL=<url>
CLOUDANT_APIKEY=<apikey>
```

#### Session cookie authentication

For `COUCHDB_SESSION` authentication, set the following environmental variables
by replacing the `<url>`, `<username>` and `<password>` with your proper
[service credentials][service-credentials].

```bash
CLOUDANT_AUTH_TYPE=COUCHDB_SESSION
CLOUDANT_URL=<url>
CLOUDANT_USERNAME=<username>
CLOUDANT_PASSWORD=<password>
```

#### Basic authentication

For *Basic authentication*, set the following environmental variables by
replacing the `<url>`, `<username>` and `<password>` with your proper
[service credentials][service-credentials].

```bash
CLOUDANT_AUTH_TYPE=BASIC
CLOUDANT_URL=<url>
CLOUDANT_USERNAME=<username>
CLOUDANT_PASSWORD=<password>
```

**Note**: We recommend that you use [IAM](#iam-authentication) for Cloudant and
[Session](#session-cookie-authentication) for CouchDB authentication.

### Authentication with external configuration

To use an external configuration file, the
[Cloudant API docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=python#authentication-with-external-configuration),
or the
[general SDK usage information](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common#using-external-configuration)
will guide you.

### Programmatic authentication

To learn more about how to use programmatic authentication, see the related
documentation in the
[Cloudant API docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=python#programmatic-authentication)
or in the
[Python SDK Core document](https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/master/Authentication.md) about authentication.

## Using the SDK

For general IBM Cloud SDK usage information, please see
[IBM Cloud SDK Common](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common/blob/master/README.md).

### Code examples

The following code examples 
[authenticate with the environment variables](#authenticate-with-environment-variables).

#### 1. Retrieve information from an existing database

**Note:** This example code assumes that `animaldb` database does not exist in your account.

This example code gathers information about an existing database hosted on
the https://examples.cloudant.com/ service `url`. To connect, you must 
extend your environment variables with the *service url* and *authentication
type* to use `NOAUTH` authentication while you connect to the `animaldb` database.
This step is necessary for the SDK to distinguish the `EXAMPLES` custom service
name from the default service name which is `CLOUDANT`.

Cloudant environment variable naming starts with a *service name* prefix that identifies your service.
By default this is `CLOUDANT`, see the settings in the
[authentication with environment variables section](#authentication-with-environment-variables).

If you would like to rename your Cloudant service from `CLOUDANT`,
you must use your defined service name as the prefix for all Cloudant related environment variables.
The code block below provides an example of instantiating a user-defined `EXAMPLES` service name.

```bash
EXAMPLES_URL=https://examples.cloudant.com
EXAMPLES_AUTH_TYPE=NOAUTH
```

Once the environment variables are set, you can try out the code examples.

[embedmd]:# (test/examples/src/get_info_from_existing_database.py)
```py
import json

from ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1

# 1. Create a Cloudant client with "EXAMPLES" service name ============
client = CloudantV1.new_instance(service_name="EXAMPLES")

# 2. Get server information ===========================================
server_information = client.get_server_information(
).get_result()

print(f'Server Version: {server_information["version"]}')

# 3. Get database information for "animaldb" ==========================
db_name = "animaldb"

db_information = client.get_database_information(
    db=db_name
).get_result()

# 4. Show document count in database ==================================
document_count = db_information["doc_count"]

print(f'Document count in \"{db_information["db_name"]}\" '
      f'database is {document_count}.')

# 5. Get zebra document out of the database by document id ============
document_about_zebra = client.get_document(
    db=db_name,
    doc_id="zebra"
).get_result()

print(f'Document retrieved from database:\n'
      f'{json.dumps(document_about_zebra, indent=2)}')
```

When you run the code, you see a result similar to the following output.

[embedmd]:# (test/examples/output/get_info_from_existing_database.txt)
```txt
Server Version: 2.1.1
Document count in "animaldb" database is 11.
Document retrieved from database:
{
  "_id": "zebra",
  "_rev": "3-750dac460a6cc41e6999f8943b8e603e",
  "wiki_page": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plains_zebra",
  "min_length": 2,
  "max_length": 2.5,
  "min_weight": 175,
  "max_weight": 387,
  "class": "mammal",
  "diet": "herbivore"
}
```

#### 2. Create your own database and add a document

**Note:** This example code assumes that `orders` database does not exist in your account.

Now comes the exciting part, you create your own `orders` database and add a document about *Bob Smith* with your own [IAM](#iam-authentication) or
[Basic](#basic-authentication) service credentials.

### Error handling

For sample code on handling errors, see
[Cloudant API docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=python#error-handling).

### Raw IO

For endpoints that read or write document content it is possible to bypass
usage of the built-in models and send or receive a bytes response.
For examples of using byte streams, see the API reference documentation
("Example request as a stream" section).
