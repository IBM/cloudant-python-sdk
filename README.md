# IBM Cloudant Python SDK Version 0.5.0

IBM Cloudant Python SDK is a client library that interacts with the
[IBM Cloudant APIs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=python).

Disclaimer: This library is still a 0.x release. We do consider this
library production-ready and capable, but there are still some
limitations we’re working to resolve, and refinements we want to
deliver. We are working really hard to minimise the disruption from
now until the 1.0 release, but there may still be some changes that
impact applications using this SDK. For now, be sure to pin versions
to avoid surprises.

## Overview

The IBM Cloudant Python SDK allows developers to programmatically
interact with [IBM Cloudant](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant)
with the help of the `ibmcloudant` package.

## Features

The purpose of this Python SDK is to wrap most of the HTTP request APIs
provided by Cloudant and supply other functions to ease the usage of Cloudant.
This SDK should make life easier for programmers to do what’s really important
to them: developing software.

Reasons why you should consider using Cloudant Python SDK in your
project:

- Supported by IBM Cloudant.
- Server compatibility with:
    - IBM Cloudant.
    - [Apache CouchDB 3.x](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/) for data operations.
- Includes all the most popular and latest supported endpoints for
  applications.
- Handles the authentication.
- Familiar user experience with IBM Cloud SDKs.
- Flexibility to use either built-in models or byte-based requests and responses for documents.
- Built-in [Changes feed follower](#changes-feed-follower-beta) (beta)
- Instances of the client are unconditionally thread-safe.

## Prerequisites

- A
  [Cloudant](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant/getting-started.html#step-1-connect-to-your-cloudant-nosql-db-service-instance-on-ibm-cloud)
  service instance or a
  [CouchDB](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/install/index.html)
  server.
- Python 3.8 or above.


## Installation

To install, use `pip` or `easy_install`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade "ibmcloudant>=0.5.0"
```

or

```bash
easy_install --upgrade "ibmcloudant>=0.5.0"
```


## Using the SDK

For fundamental SDK usage information and config options, please see the common [IBM Cloud SDK](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common/blob/main/README.md) documentation.

This library requires configuration with a service URL and
[Cloudant service credentials][service-credentials] to authenticate with your
account.

There are several ways to **set** these authentication properties:

1. As [environment variables](#authentication-with-environment-variables)
1. The [programmatic approach](#programmatic-authentication)
1. With an [external credentials file](#authentication-with-external-configuration)

The following section describes the different authentication types and provides environment variable examples.
Examples for other configuration methods are available by following the provided links.

### Authentication

[service-credentials]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-locating-your-service-credentials
[cloud-IAM-mgmt]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-managing-access-for-cloudant#introduction-iam-ai
[couch-cookie-auth]: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/server/authn.html#cookie-authentication
[cloudant-cookie-auth]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-work-with-your-account#cookie-authentication
[couch-basic-auth]: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/server/authn.html#basic-authentication
[couch-jwt-auth]: https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/server/authn.html#jwt-authentication
[cloudant-basic-auth]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-work-with-your-account#basic-authentication
[cloudant-legacy-api-keys]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-work-with-your-account#api-keys

This library requires credentials to authenticate with IBM Cloudant. These credentials may be:
* IBM Cloud IAM credentials (can be used with authentication types `CONTAINER`, `VPC` and `IAM`)
    * [IBM Cloud account][cloud-IAM-mgmt] user, service ID or trusted profile credentials
      that have been granted access to the IBM Cloud Cloudant resource instance.
    * [IBM Cloudant service credentials][service-credentials] generated by the IBM Cloud Cloudant resource instance.
* Username and password credentials (can be used with authentication types `COUCHDB_SESSION` and `BASIC`)
    * [IBM Cloudant service credentials][service-credentials] generated for an IBM Cloud Cloudant resource instance not configured as `IAM only`.
    * IBM Cloudant [legacy credentials][cloudant-basic-auth] (i.e. username and password) for instances not in IBM Cloud.
    * IBM Cloudant [legacy API keys][cloudant-legacy-api-keys].

For other compatible APIs that are not Cloudant accounts (e.g. Apache CouchDB) non-IAM based authentication types
must be used.

This table summarizes the available authentication types.
The authentication types are listed in order of recommendation, preferably use the authentication type
from the first row in the table that is compatible with your environment.

| Authenitcation type | Recommended for | `AUTH_TYPE` | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IAM Trusted Profiles compute resource ([container](https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/main/Authentication.md#container-authentication)) | Cloudant<BR>(SDK running in IBM Cloud IKS) | `CONTAINER` | Obtains a compute resource (CR) token from the container.<BR>Exchanges the CR token for an IAM `access_token`.<BR>Adds an `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header to each HTTP request.<BR>Automatically renews the access token when needed. |
| IAM Trusted Profiles compute resource ([VPC](https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/main/Authentication.md#vpc-instance-authentication)) | Cloudant<BR>(SDK running in IBM Cloud VPC)| `VPC` | Obtains an identity token from the VPC instance metadata.<BR>Exchanges the identity token for an IAM `access_token`.<BR>Adds an `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header to each HTTP request.<BR>Automatically renews the access token when needed. |
| [IAM API key](https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/main/Authentication.md#identity-and-access-management-iam-authentication) | Cloudant | `IAM` | Exchanges an IAM API key for an IAM `access_token`.<BR>Adds an `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header to each HTTP request.<BR>Automatically renews the access token when needed. | 
| [Session cookie](#session-cookie-authentication) | [Cloudant][cloudant-cookie-auth]<BR>(legacy credentials & instances without IAM)<BR><BR>[Apache CouchDB][couch-cookie-auth] | `COUCHDB_SESSION` | Exchanges credentials with `/_session` endpoint to retrieve a cookie.<BR>Adds `Cookie` header and content to each HTTP request.<BR>Automatically renews session when needed. |
| [Bearer token](https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/main/Authentication.md#bearer-token-authentication) | [Apache CouchDB][couch-jwt-auth]<BR>(using JWT authentication) | `BEARERTOKEN` | Adds an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to each HTTP request.<BR>No token management or renewal.<BR>Also compatible with IAM access tokens managed independently of the SDK. |
| [Basic](https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/main/Authentication.md#basic-authentication) | [Apache CouchDB][couch-basic-auth]<BR>(if cookies are not enabled) | `BASIC` | Adds an `Authorization: Basic <encoded username and password>` header to each HTTP request. |
| [None](https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/main/Authentication.md#no-auth-authentication) | - | `NOAUTH` | Note that this authentication type only works for operations against a database allowing access for unauthenticated users.

The default authentication type for the SDK is `CONTAINER` unless `APIKEY` configuration is supplied, which changes the default authentication type to `IAM`.

#### Authentication with environment variables

The default service name is `CLOUDANT` so `CLOUDANT_` prefixed names are used in these examples.

Any custom service name prefix can be used as long as the matching name is used to instantiate the SDK client
and the same prefix is used for all configuration options.

##### IAM API key authentication

For Cloudant *IAM API key authentication*, set the following environmental variables by
replacing the `<url>` and `<apikey>` with your proper
[service credentials][service-credentials]. There is no need to set
`CLOUDANT_AUTH_TYPE` to `IAM` because it is the default when an `APIKEY` is set.

```bash
CLOUDANT_URL=<url>
CLOUDANT_APIKEY=<apikey>
```

##### IAM Trusted profile (container) authentication

For Cloudant *IAM Trusted profile compute resource container authentication*, set the following environmental variables by
replacing the `<url>` and `<id>` with your values. There is no need to set
`CLOUDANT_AUTH_TYPE` to `CONTAINER` because it is the default.

```bash
CLOUDANT_URL=<url>
CLOUDANT_IAM_PROFILE_ID=<id>
```

Alternatively a profile name may be used instead of an ID by replacing `CLOUDANT_IAM_PROFILE_ID` with `CLOUDANT_IAM_PROFILE_NAME`.

##### IAM Trusted profile (VPC) authentication

For Cloudant *IAM Trusted profile compute resource vpc authentication*, set the following environmental variables by
replacing the `<url>` and `<id>` with your values.

```bash
CLODUANT_AUTH_TYPE=VPC
CLOUDANT_URL=<url>
CLOUDANT_IAM_PROFILE_ID=<id>
```

Alternatively a profile CRN may be used instead of an ID by replacing `CLOUDANT_IAM_PROFILE_ID` with `CLOUDANT_IAM_PROFILE_CRN`.

##### Session cookie authentication

For `COUCHDB_SESSION` authentication, set the following environmental variables
by replacing the `<url>`, `<username>` and `<password>` with your proper
[service credentials][service-credentials].

```bash
CLOUDANT_AUTH_TYPE=COUCHDB_SESSION
CLOUDANT_URL=<url>
CLOUDANT_USERNAME=<username>
CLOUDANT_PASSWORD=<password>
```

#### Authentication with external configuration

To use an external configuration file, the
[Cloudant API docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=python#authentication-with-external-configuration),
or the
[general SDK usage information](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common#using-external-configuration)
will guide you.

#### Programmatic authentication

To learn more about how to use programmatic authentication, see the related
documentation in the
[Cloudant API docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=python#programmatic-authentication)
or in the
[Python SDK Core document](https://github.com/IBM/python-sdk-core/blob/main/Authentication.md) about authentication.

### Request timeout configuration

No request timeout is defined, but a 2.5m read and a 60s connect timeout are set by default. Be sure to set a request timeout appropriate to your application usage and environment.
The [request timeout](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common/blob/main/README.md) section contains details on how to change the value.

**Note:** System settings may take precedence over configured timeout values.

### Code examples

The following code examples
[authenticate with the environment variables](#authentication-with-environment-variables).

#### 1. Create a database and add a document

**Note:** This example code assumes that `orders` database does not exist in your account.

This example code creates `orders` database and adds a new document "example"
into it. To connect, you must set your environment variables with
the *service url*, *authentication type* and *authentication credentials*
of your Cloudant service.

Cloudant environment variable naming starts with a *service name* prefix that identifies your service.
By default, this is `CLOUDANT`, see the settings in the
[authentication with environment variables section](#authentication-with-environment-variables).

If you would like to rename your Cloudant service from `CLOUDANT`,
you must use your defined service name as the prefix for all Cloudant related environment variables.

Once the environment variables are set, you can try out the code examples.

# 2. Create a database ================================================
example_db_name = "orders"

# Try to create database if it doesn't exist
try:
    put_database_result = client.put_database(
        db=example_db_name
    ).get_result()
    if put_database_result["ok"]:
        print(f'"{example_db_name}" database created.')
except ApiException as ae:
    if ae.code == 412:
        print(f'Cannot create "{example_db_name}" database, ' +
              'it already exists.')

# 3. Create a document ================================================
# Create a document object with "example" id
example_doc_id = "example"
# Setting `id` for the document is optional when "post_document"
# function is used for CREATE. When `id` is not provided the server
# will generate one for your document.
example_document: Document = Document(id=example_doc_id)

# Add "name" and "joined" fields to the document
example_document.name = "Bob Smith"
example_document.joined = "2019-01-24T10:42:59.000Z"

# Save the document in the database with "post_document" function
create_document_response = client.post_document(
    db=example_db_name,
    document=example_document
).get_result()

# =====================================================================
# Note: saving the document can also be done with the "put_document"
# function. In this case `doc_id` is required for a CREATE operation:
"""
create_document_response = client.put_document(
    db=example_db_name,
    doc_id=example_doc_id,

# Keeping track of the revision number of the document object
# is necessary for further UPDATE/DELETE operations:
example_document.rev = create_document_response["rev"]
print(f'You have created the document:\n{example_document}')
```

When you run the code, you see a result similar to the following output.

[embedmd]:# (test/examples/output/create_db_and_doc.txt)
```txt

#### 2. Retrieve information from an existing database

**Note**: This example code assumes that you have created both the `orders`
database and the `example` document by
[running the previous example code](#1-create-a-database-and-add-a-document)
successfully. Otherwise, the following error message occurs, "Cannot delete document because either 'orders'

#### Further code examples

For a complete list of code examples, see the [examples directory](examples#examples-for-python).

### Error handling

For sample code on handling errors, see
[Cloudant API docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=python#error-handling).

### Raw IO

For endpoints that read or write document content it is possible to bypass
usage of the built-in object with byte streams.

Depending on the specific SDK operation it may be possible to:
* accept a user-provided byte stream to send to the server as a request body
* return a byte stream of the server response body to the user

Request byte stream can be supplied for arguments that accept the `BinaryIO` type.
For these cases you can pass this byte stream directly to the HTTP request body.

Response byte stream is supported in functions with the suffix of `_as_stream`.
The returned byte stream allows the response body to be consumed
without triggering JSON unmarshalling that is typically performed by the SDK.

The [update document](#3-update-your-previously-created-document) section
contains examples for both request and response byte stream cases.

The API reference contains further examples of using byte streams.
They are titled "Example request as stream" and are initially collapsed.
Expand them to see examples of:

- Byte requests:
  - [Bulk modify multiple documents in a database](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=python#postbulkdocs)

- Byte responses:
  - [Query a list of all documents in a database](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=python#postalldocs)
  - [Query the database document changes feed](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=python#postchanges)

### Model classes vs dictionaries

This SDK supports two possible formats to define an HTTP request. One approach uses only model classes and the other only dictionaries.

### Changes feed follower (beta)

#### Introduction

The SDK provides a changes feed follower utility (currently beta).
This helper utility connects to the `_changes` endpoint and returns the individual change items.
It removes some of the complexity of using the `_changes` endpoint by setting some options automatically
and providing error suppression and retries.

*Tip: the changes feed often does not meet user expectations or assumptions.*

Consult the [Cloudant changes feed FAQ](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-changes-feed)
to get a better understanding of the limitations and suitable use-cases before using the changes feed in your application.

#### Modes of operation

There are two modes of operation:
* Start mode
    * Fetches the changes from the supplied `since` sequence (by default the feed will start from `now`).
    * Fetches all available changes and then continues listening for new changes indefinitely unless encountering an end condition.
    * An example use case for this mode is event driven workloads.
* Start one-off mode
    * Fetches the changes from the supplied `since` sequence (by default the feed will start from the beginning).
    * Fetches all available changes and then stops when either there are no further changes pending or encountering an end condition.
    * An example use case for this mode is ETL style workloads.

#### Configuring the changes follower

The SDK's model of changes feed options is also used to configure the follower.
However, a subset of the options are invalid as they are configured internally by the implementation.
Supplying these options when instantiating the follower causes an error.
The invalid options are:
* `descending`
* `feed`
* `heartbeat`
* `lastEventId` - use `since` instead
* `timeout`
* Only the value of `_selector` is permitted for the `filter` option. This restriction is because selector
  based filters perform better than JavaScript backed filters. Configuring a non-selector based filter will
  cause the follower to error.

Note that that the `limit` parameter will terminate the follower at the given number of changes in either
operating mode.

The changes follower requires the client to have HTTP timeouts of at least 1 minute and will error during
instantiation if it is insufficient. The default client configuration has sufficiently long timeouts.

For use-cases where these configuration limitations are deemed too restrictive then it is recommended to
write code to use the SDK's [POST `_changes` API](examples#postchanges) instead of the follower.

#### Error suppression

By default the changes follower will suppress transient errors indefinitely and attempt to run to completion or listen forever as
dictated by the opreating mode.
For applications where that is not desirable an optional error tolerance duration may be specified to control the time since
the last successful response that transient errors will be suppressed. This can be used, for example,  by applications as a grace period
before reporting an error and requiring intervention.

There are some additional points to consider for error suppression:
* Errors considered terminal, for example, the database not existing or invalid credentials are never suppressed and will error immediately.
* The error suppression duration is not guaranteed to fire immediately after lapsing and should be considered a minimum supppression time.
* The changes follower will back-off between retries and as such may remain paused for a short while after the transient errors have resolved.
* If the underlying SDK client used to initialize the follower also has retries configured then errors could be suppressed for significantly
  longer than the follower's configured error tolerance duration depending on the configuration options.

#### Follower operation

For both modes:
* The end conditions are:
    * A terminal error (HTTP codes `400`, `401`, `403` `404`).
    * Transient errors occur for longer than the error tolerance duration. Transient errors are all other HTTP status codes and connection errors.
    * The number of changes received reaches the configured `limit`.
    * The feed is terminated early by calling stop.

As is true for the `_changes` endpoint change items have _at least once_ delivery and an individual item
may be received multiple times. When using the follower change items may be repeated even within a limited
number of changes (i.e. using the `limit` option) this is a minor difference from using `limit` on the HTTP native API.

The follower is not optimized for some use cases and it is not recommended to use it in cases where:
* Setting `include_docs` and larger document sizes (for example > 10 kiB).
* The volume of changes is very high (if the rate of changes in the database exceeds the follower's rate of pulling them it will never catch-up).

In these cases use-case specific control over the number of change requests made and the content size of the responses
may be achived by using the SDK's [POST `_changes` API](examples#postchanges).

#### Checkpointing

The changes follower does not checkpoint since it has no information about whether a change item has been
processed by the consuming application after being received. It is the application developer's responsibility
to store the sequence IDs to have appropriate checkpoints and to re-initialize the follower with the required
`since` value after, for example, the application restarts.

The frequency and conditions for checkpointing are application specific and some applications may be tolerant
of dropped changes. This section is intended only to provide general guidance on how to avoid missing changes.

To guarantee processing of all changes the sequence ID from a change item must not be persisted until _after_
the processing of the change item by the application has completed. As indicated previously change items are
delivered _at least once_ so application code must be able to handle repeated changes already and it is
preferable to restart from an older `since` value and receive changes again than risk missing them.

The sequence IDs are available on each change item by default, but may be ommitted from some change items when
using the `seq_interval` configuration option. Infrequent sequence IDs may improve performance by reducing
the amount of data that needs to be transferred, but the trade-off is that more changes will be repeated if
it is necessary to resume the changes follower.

Extreme care should be taken with persisting sequences if choosing to process change items in parallel as there
is a considerable risk of missing changes on a restart if the sequence is recorded out of order.

#### Code examples

##### Initializing a changes follower
[embedmd]:# (test/examples/src/features/initialize.py /import/ $)
```py
import ChangesFollower
from ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1

client = CloudantV1.new_instance()

cf_params = {
    'db': 'example',  # Required: the database name.
    'limit': 100,  # Optional: return only 100 changes (including duplicates).
    'since': '3-g1AG3...'  # Optional: start from this sequence ID (e.g. with a value read from persistent storage).
}

changes_follower = ChangesFollower(
    service=client,  # Required: the Cloudant service client instance.
    error_tolerance=10000,  # Optional: suppress transient errors for at least 10 seconds before terminating.
    **cf_params  # Required: changes feed configuration options dict.
)
```


##### Starting the changes follower

###### Start mode for continuous listening
[embedmd]:# (test/examples/src/features/start.py /import/ $)
```py
import Iterable

from ibmcloudant import ChangesFollower
from ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1, ChangesResultItem

client = CloudantV1.new_instance()

changes_follower = ChangesFollower(
    service=client,
    **{'db': 'example'})

changes_items: Iterable[ChangesResultItem] = changes_follower.start()
# Note: iterable will not do anything until it is iterated
# Create a for loop to iterate over the flow of changes
# for changes_item in changes_items: ...
```


###### Start mode for one-off fetching
[embedmd]:# (test/examples/src/features/start_one_off.py /import/ $)
```py
import Iterable

from ibmcloudant import ChangesFollower
from ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1, ChangesResultItem

client = CloudantV1.new_instance()

changes_follower = ChangesFollower(
    service=client,
    **{'db': 'example'})

changes_items: Iterable[ChangesResultItem] = changes_follower.start_one_off()
# Note: iterable will not do anything until it is iterated
# Create a for loop to iterate over the flow of changes
# for changes_item in changes_items: ...
```


##### Processing changes

###### Process continuous changes
[embedmd]:# (test/examples/src/features/start_and_process.py /import/ $)
```py
import ChangesFollower
from ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1

client = CloudantV1.new_instance()

# Start from a previously persisted seq
# Normally this would be read by the app from persistent storage
# e.g. previously_persisted_seq = your_app_persistence_read_func()
previously_persisted_seq = '3-g1AG3...'
changes_follower = ChangesFollower(
    service=client,
    **{'db': 'example', 'since': previously_persisted_seq})

changes_items = changes_follower.start()
for changes_item in changes_items:
    # do something with changes
    print(changes_item.id)
    for change in changes_item.changes:
        print(change.rev)
    # when change item processing is complete app can store seq
    seq = changes_item.seq
    # write seq to persistent storage for use as since if required to resume later
    # e.g. your_app_persistence_write_func(seq)
    # keep processing changes until the application is terminated or some other stop condition is reached

# Note: iterator above is blocking, code here will be unreachable
# until the iteration is stopped or another stop condition is reached.
# For long running followers careful consideration should be made of where to call stop on the iterator.
```


###### Process one-off changes
[embedmd]:# (test/examples/src/features/start_one_off_and_process.py /import/ $)
```py
import ChangesFollower
from ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1

client = CloudantV1.new_instance()

# Start from a previously persisted seq
# Normally this would be read by the app from persistent storage
# e.g. previously_persisted_seq = your_app_persistence_read_func()
previously_persisted_seq = '3-g1AG3...'
changes_follower = ChangesFollower(
    service=client,
    **{'db': 'example', 'since': previously_persisted_seq})

changes_items = changes_follower.start_one_off()
for changes_item in changes_items:
    # do something with changes
    print(changes_item.id)
    for change in changes_item.changes:
        print(change.rev)
    # when change item processing is complete app can store seq
    seq = changes_item.seq
    # write seq to persistent storage for use as since if required to resume later
    # e.g. your_app_persistence_write_func(seq)

# Note: iterator above is blocking, code here will be unreachable
# until all changes are processed (or another stop condition is reached).
```


##### Stopping the changes follower
[embedmd]:# (test/examples/src/features/stop.py /import/ $)
```py
import ChangesFollower
from ibmcloudant.cloudant_v1 import CloudantV1

client = CloudantV1.new_instance()
changes_follower = ChangesFollower(
    service=client,
    **{'db': 'example'})
changes_items = changes_follower.start()

for changes_item in changes_items:
    # Option 1: call stop after some condition
    # Note that since the iterator is blocking at least one item
    # must be returned from it to reach to this point.
    # Additional changes may be processed before the iterator stops.
    changes_follower.stop()

# Option 2: call stop method when you want to end the continuous loop from
# outside the iterator.  For example, you've put the changes follower in a
# separate thread and need to call stop on the main thread.
# Note: in this context the call must be made from a different thread because
# code immediately following the iterator is unreachable until the iterator
# has stopped.
changes_follower.stop()
```
