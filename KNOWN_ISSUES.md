# Limitations, Restrictions, and Known Issues

## All Cloudant SDKs

### Path elements containing the `+` character

Path elements containing the `+` character in the SDKs are not interoperable with Apache CouchDB and Cloudant.
* This is because standard URL encoding libraries following the [RFC3986 URI specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3) do not encode this character in path elements.
* Apache CouchDB violates the specification by treating the `+` in path elements as a space character (see https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2235).
* Path elements include database names, all document names, and index and view names.
* It is possible to workaround for document names with a `+` in the ID (e.g. `docidwith+char`) by using:
    * For reading: use the `post` all docs operation and the `key` or `keys` parameter with a value of the document ID including the `+`.
    * For writing: use the `post` document operation or `post` bulk docs operation with the value of the document ID including the `+`.
* There is no pre-encoding workaround because the result is a double encoding e.g. using `%2b` in the path element ends up being double encoded as `%252b`.

### Views

#### Objects as keys

Using JSON objects as keys (e.g. `start_key`, `end_key`, `key`, `keys`)
can cause inconsistent results because the ordering of the members of the JSON
object after serialization is not guaranteed.

### Search

#### Cannot use `drilldown` parameters

Drilldown parameters cannot be used for search queries with server versions:
* CouchDB versions <=3.1.0
* Cloudant <= 8158

### Cloudant on Transaction Engine

Whilst most SDK methods will work with _Cloudant on Transaction Engine_ there are some limitations.
It should be noted that not all existing API options are applicable to _Cloudant on Transaction Engine_
and new API options added in _Cloudant on Transaction Engine_ are not yet available in the SDKs. Please
consult the Cloudant documentation for further information.
