# Questions
If you are having problems using the APIs or have a question about IBM Cloud services,
please ask a question at
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=ibm-cloud).

# Issues
If you encounter an issue with the project, you are welcome to submit a
[bug report](https://github.com/IBM/cloudant-python-sdk/issues).
Before that, please search for similar issues. It's possible that someone has already reported the problem.

# PRs
Much of the code in this repository is generated from
Cloudant's OpenAPI specification. This means PRs
to code, tests and sometimes even markdown
are often inappropriate and we may need to make
changes to the specification instead. For this reason
we ask that an **issue is always opened prior to a PR**
to give us the opportunity to discuss the best place
for the change before investing your effort on a patch
that we may not be able to accept.
