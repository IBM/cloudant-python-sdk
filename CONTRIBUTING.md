# Questions
If you are having problems using the APIs or have a question about IBM Cloud services,
please ask a question at
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=ibm-cloud).

# Issues
If you encounter an issue with the project, you are welcome to submit a
[bug report](https://github.com/IBM/cloudant-python-sdk/issues).
Before that, please search for similar issues. It's possible that someone has already reported the problem.

# PRs
We ask that an **issue is always opened prior to a PR** to give us the
opportunity to discuss the best place for the change before investing
your effort on a patch that we may not be able to accept.

The code in the repository is partly generated from the Cloudant OpenAPI
specification. This means PRs to code, tests and sometimes even markdown
are often inappropriate and we may need to make changes to the specification
instead. Please, first [look at the list of files](.github/CODEOWNERS) that
_should not_ be modified.

Before submitting your pull request, please ensure you've reviewed and adhere to our [AI policy](AI_CODE_POLICY.md).
